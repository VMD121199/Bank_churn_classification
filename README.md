## Introduction

In this project, I develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn in a bank. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. By identifying potential churners, the bank can take proactive measures to retain customers and improve customer satisfaction.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python3.9 installed. You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:
`pip install -r requirement.txt`

## Models

The following machine learning models are used in this project:

- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

Each model is trained and evaluated using the provided dataset to predict customer churn.
